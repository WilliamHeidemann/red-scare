All scripts are located in the red-scare/exercise/src folder.

The project requires pandas, which must be installed beforehand with pip for it to run correctly.

To generate the results, run the Runner.py script inside the src folder. This will populate the file called results.csv in the Database folder.

If you prefer a text file instead, simply rename results.csv to results.txt after running.
