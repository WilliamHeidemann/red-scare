# Claim: Some Problem is NP-hard

Proof. We will reduce from Other Problem, which is known to be NP-hard.

Let ... be an instance of Other Problem. (...)

Construct and instance ... of Some Problem as follows. (...).

For example, if ... is an instance to Other Problem then the resuling instance to Some Problem is ....

(Note that the size of ... is polynomial in the size of ....)

Now let ... be a solution to Some Problem for the instance ....

Conversely, if ... is a solution to Other Problem, then ....
