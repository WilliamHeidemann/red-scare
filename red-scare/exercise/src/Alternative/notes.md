### Quick Solver explanation
- The solver performs a BFS
- it checks neibours if color differs
- if unvisited, queue and mark visited
- if end node reached, return true else false
- profit

### Todo
same as None
- wait for parser to test/debug/experiment
- set up class that:
    - takes path to data directory
    - loops files (graphs)
